Javascript Objects
=================
Come geek out about some of the most interesting parts of javascript and see how cleverly they work together to make it possible to write object oriented code. Learn how to use language features like the object literal, functions as first class objects, anonymous functions, constructor functions, closures and the object prototype and really understand how they work. Whether you are a javascript beginner or have used the language for years, are interested in writing plain javascript or just understanding what your favourite framework is doing, this session will give you a deeper understanding of how the language actually works. 

Here are the samples, exercises and slides for the presentation.
